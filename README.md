# üìß Cold Mail Generator
Cold email generator for services company using groq, langchain and streamlit. It allows users to input the URL of a company's careers page. The tool then extracts job listings from that page and generates personalized cold emails. These emails include relevant portfolio links sourced from a vector database, based on the specific job descriptions. 

**Imagine a scenario:**

- Nike needs a Principal Software Engineer and is spending time and resources in the hiring process, on boarding, training etc
- Momina Ather is an Software/AI ENgineer who can provide a dedicated software development engineer to Nike. So, the business development executive (Momina) is going to reach out to Nike via a cold email.
